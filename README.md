# Travel-agency-application
An application that was created using MIT APP Inventor and that allows browsing the historical sights of the Unsko-Sana Canton.

The tourist places of the Una-Sana Canton represent a wealth of natural beauty, historical sights and cultural heritage, which makes them attractive destinations for domestic and foreign visitors. This topic will be addressed because the Una-Sana Canton has a huge tourism potential that is not sufficiently promoted with modern digital tools. The inspiration for the application comes from his own love for nature and the history of the canton, as well as his desire to contribute to its promotion. The goal is to help all cities to progress, but also to help other tourists to have the opportunity to see everything that surrounds the citizens of USK on a daily basis.
Application development in MIT App Inventor made it possible to design an application to create a useful product that can help tourists explore the Una-Sana Canton. The application is significant because it provides a simple and intuitive way to get to know the sights of the canton, such as the Old Town of Ostrožac, the Una river and numerous other beauties.
This project has the potential to improve the tourism offer of the region, making information about destinations available to a wider audience via mobile devices. We are witnessing that most people today spend a large part of their day on mobile devices, so an application for advertising a place is an excellent choice.

The initial screen presents access to the application itself and password entry. Above is a picture representing part of the canton, and we also have a welcome message.

After the user successfully logs in, they will be taken to a second screen. The second screen offers the option to choose one of the 8 cities in USC, with only Cazin currently functional.

After the user selects the functional city of Cazin, they have the opportunity to see a picture of the city and below it a button with a tone. This is the button that will play the selected song. The song "Cazin grade moj" will then be activated. A clock and a 10-second time limit for listening to the selected song are also set. This can be manipulated so that the song starts after entering this screen and stops after leaving the screen or lasts longer after clicking the button.

There is a possibility to see the history of the city of Cazin.

If the user selects tourist sites on the Cazin screen, they will be brought to this screen. The two largest tourist attractions of the city of Cazin are offered here. Their pictures are visible, and below that, a button with the names of the attractions. If they want to see more pictures, a short text or the most important information about the time of visit, then the user should click on the button for that attraction.

The old town of Ostrožac represents one of the most significant historical and cultural features of the Una-Sana Canton. Located on a hill overlooking the Una River, this city offers a unique experience to its visitors. The walls of the castle, the tower and the spacious park are ideal for exploring and taking photos. [3] Also, various cultural and artistic events are organized here throughout the year, which further adds to its significance. For all the above reasons, this is an important destination in the area of this city.

If we pay attention only to the design, then this screen has the same aesthetics as the Old Town Ostrožac screen. The idea is the same, which is to display a picture, text and horizontally arranged pictures of the destination we are talking about.

After each screen there is a leave a review button that leads directly to this screen. At any time while the user is using the application, he can go to this page to express his opinion and experience.
